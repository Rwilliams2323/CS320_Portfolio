Reflection on Software Projects
Throughout the projects in this course, I have learned a great deal about software development, testing, and quality assurance. These experiences have helped me understand the importance of functionality, security, user needs, and software design. Below, Iâ€™ll share my reflections on how I approached each aspect during the projects.

To ensure that my code, program, or software is both functional and secure, I relied heavily on unit testing and validation. Using tests like those in ContactTest.java and ContactServiceTest.java, I was able to verify that each function behaved as expected under various conditions. This process allowed me to detect and address bugs early, ensuring that the software would perform reliably in production. In addition to functionality, I considered security by following best practices such as validating inputs, handling exceptions properly, and minimizing vulnerabilities that could be exploited.

Interpreting user needs and incorporating them into a program requires clear communication and a thorough understanding of requirements. In these projects, I approached user needs by first breaking down the requirements into smaller, manageable tasks. Each user requirement was directly linked to specific tests that would validate whether the software met expectations. By defining user stories and scenarios, I ensured that the software delivered was both functional and aligned with the users' needs. This user-centric approach made it easier to focus development on features that provided value, avoiding unnecessary complexity.

Designing software requires a balance of planning, flexibility, and iterative development. I approached software design by starting with a clear architecture plan, using object-oriented principles to keep code modular and maintainable. By creating a solid structure in the Contact.java and ContactService.java files, I made sure that the software components were decoupled and easy to modify. As the projects evolved, I frequently revisited and refined the design to accommodate new requirements and user feedback. I used Agile-inspired principles, embracing small, iterative changes and focusing on delivering working code in increments.

Overall, my work in these projects has deepened my understanding of software development, particularly in the areas of testing, requirement analysis, and design. These experiences have not only improved my technical skills but have also highlighted the importance of a methodical and user-focused approach to creating software. This reflection will serve as a guidepost for my future work, reminding me of the value of clarity, precision, and iterative improvement in software projects.
